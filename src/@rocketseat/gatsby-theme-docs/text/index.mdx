# Kabayan! Start your engines!

## Iskolar
    
Naghahanap po kami ng iskolar. Lima lang po muna
sa simula. Baguhan kami rito at kung ikaw ang tipong
makakatulong sa amin, paki email sa 
**pp2e@protonmail.com**.
We are looking for doers and entrepreneurial mindset.
If your ambition is a 9-to-5 job, this is not for you.



## Updates

- **2021-11-18** :
Release schedule updated. Beta test of game from Friday (11/19) to Sunday (11/21).
However, PP2E is still waiting for NFT delivery.  It would be nice if would-be iskolars
can participate during the beta test window.  We shall see if the Kart Racing League team delivers.

As of today, KRL tech support is a no-show.

Telegram admins advised to wait for a few days.
Okay, let's do that.
