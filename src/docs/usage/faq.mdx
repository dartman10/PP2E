## What is EoC?

    Essence of Creation (EoC)
    If you know Axie, it is similar to SLP.
    EoC is the in-game currency.
    Use for leveling up and other in-game actions.
    Earn EoC when you play the game.


## Entrepreneurial mindset?

    We are not your typical guild.  PP2E is not
    about keeping iskolars to be iskolars forever.
    We help iskolars to graduate, to become NFT
    owners themselves.
