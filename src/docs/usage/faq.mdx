## What is EoC?

Essence of Creation (EoC). If you know Axie, it 
is similar to SLP, it is the in-game currency. 
Use it for leveling up. Earn EoC when you play the game.


## Entrepreneurial mindset?

We are not like your typical guild. PP2E is not
about keeping iskolars to stay iskolars forever.
We help iskolars to graduate, to become NFT
owners themselves.  And, no, we are not a guild.
